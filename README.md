After several hours searching for a solution, to convert a html web server file into an ARDUINO PROGMEM readable format,
I decided not to waist more time in the internet and wrote a VB6 script, compiled it and the *exe file works perfectly on my system. (In my case Windows 7 SP1)
How to use:
Run html2progmem.exe
At the start up screen, drag and drop the *.html file onto the Text Box.
After approx. 2 seconds, you’ll find the output file near by your *.html file.
Same name as the *.html file but with a *.txt extension.
Next step as usual:
Open the *.txt file, and copy / paste it into your IDE.
That’s it.

all double quotes has been replaced by \”                                       
each line has a leading “                                                       
each line ends with \n”
